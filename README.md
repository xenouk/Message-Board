# Message-Board
University Year 2, Advanced Object-Oriented Programming - Assignment 1

Message Boards provide a forum for communication by maintaining lists of messages that have been sent by users, which can be viewed and added to by other users. These messages are usually organised by topic. Users can typically start a new topic, or view a list of all topics that have been started by other users. From this list they can choose one topic and view the messages that have been sent under that topic. Users also have the option of adding a message to a particular topic. The list of topics is typically sorted by the time a topic was last added to, with topics that were most recently added to coming first.
